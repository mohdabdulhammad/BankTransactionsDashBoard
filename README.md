Project Title / Headline
Bank Transaction Dashboard: Real-time Analytics for Financial Operations

Project Detail
This project delivers a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing bank transaction data in real-time. The dashboard provides actionable insights into transaction volumes, amounts, statuses, fraud detection, transaction types, and regional distribution, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance operational efficiency.
Short Description / Purpose
The purpose of the Bank Transaction Dashboard is to provide financial institutions with a centralized, interactive platform to track key metrics related to banking transactions. By visualizing data such as transaction counts, amounts, fraud flags, and regional activity, the dashboard helps identify trends, detect anomalies, and optimize banking operations.

Tech Stack
•	Frontend: Power BI (for dashboard visualization and interactivity)
•	Backend/Data Processing: Likely uses SQL databases or cloud-based data sources (e.g., Azure SQL, AWS RDS)
•	Data Integration: Power Query 
•	Mapping: Microsoft Bing Maps integration for geographic visualization

Data Source
•	The dataset used for this dashboard was sourced from a reputable online open data repository. It contains anonymized records of bank transactions, including fields such as transaction ID, timestamp, transaction type (transfer, deposit, withdrawal), status (success/failure), amount, device used, network slice ID, fraud flag, and geographic location. Features / Highlights
•	Total Transactions & Amount: Displays real-time counts and cumulative transaction values.
•	Time Series Analysis: Line chart showing transaction trends over time.
•	Transaction Status: Visual breakdown of successful vs. failed transactions.
•	Fraud Detection: Donut chart indicating the proportion of transactions flagged as fraudulent.
•	Transaction Type Analysis: Visual distribution of transfers, deposits, and withdrawals.
•	Geographic Visualization: Interactive world map highlighting transaction distribution by region.
•	Dynamic Filtering: Filters for transaction type, status, device used, and network slice ID for granular analysis.

Example
A bank manager uses the dashboard to monitor a sudden spike in failed transactions in Europe. By filtering by region and status, they quickly identify a network issue affecting withdrawals, allowing for rapid resolution and improved customer satisfaction.
Key Questions Addressed by the Dashboard
•	What is the total number and value of transactions processed in a given period?
•	What proportion of transactions are successful versus failed?
•	How many transactions are flagged as potentially fraudulent?
•	What are the trends in transaction volume over time?
•	Which transaction types (transfer, deposit, withdrawal) are most common?
•	How are transactions distributed geographically?
•	Are there specific regions or time periods with higher failure or fraud rates?
•	How do device usage and network slice ID impact transaction outcomes?
